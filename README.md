[00:02.75] The sun doesn't shine when you're not here
[00:06.89] Baby, am I making things clear?
[00:10.93] Tell me that everything's alright
[00:14.27] Can you love me tonight?
[00:15.96] Can you love me tonight?
[00:27.96] 
[00:18.45] The mood isn't right when you're too far
[00:22.43] Maybe I'm making things too hard
[00:26.15] Tell me that everything's alright
[00:29.64] Can you love me tonight?
[00:31.70] Can you love me tonight?
[00:43.70] 
[00:35.06] I can take you all around the world, my pleasure
[00:38.87] I ain't got my eyes on other girls
[00:41.41] You told me, "Be a better man"
[00:43.88] I'm tired of playing pretend
[00:45.85] I didn't listen, now I'm wishing for a second chance, yeah
[01:14.85] 
[00:50.01] Hit you up last night (yeah)
[00:52.63] Something was different, didn't feel too right
[00:56.51] Right from the moment, when you left me on read
[00:59.87] Started texting your friends
[01:01.29] Like, "Look what he said again"
[01:03.69] He said
[01:07.19] 
[01:04.69] The sun doesn't shine when you're not here
[01:08.62] Baby, am I making things clear?
[01:12.63] Tell me that everything's alright
[01:16.18] Can you love me tonight?
[01:18.16] Can you love me tonight?
[01:30.16] 
[01:20.44] The mood isn't right when you're too far
[01:24.30] Maybe I'm making things too hard
[01:28.39] Tell me that everything's alright
[01:31.72] Can you love me tonight?
[01:33.49] Can you love me tonight?
[01:45.49] 
[01:37.15] You say I never see your point of view
[01:41.12] But every time you say it, I'm confused
[01:43.91] Tried to communicate, I guess our feelings changed
[01:47.82] And now I'm blocked by your friends too
[02:07.32] 
[01:51.49] So I hit you up last night (yeah)
[01:54.67] Something was different, didn't feel too right
[01:58.25] Right from the moment, when you left me on read
[02:01.44] I started texting my friends
[02:03.41] Like, "Look at what I just sent"
[02:05.45] I said
[02:08.45] 
[02:06.70] The sun doesn't shine when you're not here
[02:10.98] Baby, am I making things clear?
[02:14.66] Tell me that everything's alright
[02:18.08] Can you love me tonight?
[02:20.04] Can you love me tonight?
[02:32.04] 
[02:22.18] The mood isn't right when you're too far

[02:58.32]
